## Create and view data using scripts

Two scripts are included in this project for creating and viewing user entities.

Use the `create-user.sh` script to create a user.

```bash
./bin/create-user.sh user456 user456 user456.example.com
```

The script takes three parameters: userId, name, and email.

Use the `get-user,sh` script to view existing user entities.

```bash
./bin/get-user.sh user456
```
